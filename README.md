==>**** Overview****

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data analytics workflow.
It covers dataset loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, SQL querying, dashboard creation in Power BI, and final reporting using Gamma.
The objective is to uncover insights, improve data quality, and build a clear analytical story supported by visuals and documentation.

==> **Dataset**

The dataset was provided as a CSV file and contains customer purchase information.

Key columns include demographics, purchase amounts, order details, product categories, and discount usage.

The dataset was analyzed to understand customer behavior, revenue patterns, and product performance.

🛠 **Tools & Technologies**

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn) – Data loading, cleaning, and EDA

SQL Server – Running analytical SQL queries on cleaned data

Power BI – Building an interactive dashboard

Gamma App – Creating final report and presentation

Excel/CSV – Input and output data handling

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code – Development environment

** Steps Performed**
1. Load Dataset into Python

Imported the dataset using Pandas

Inspected structure, data types, missing values, and duplicates

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Univariate & bivariate analysis

Summary statistics (mean, median, distribution)

Visualization of key variables (histograms, boxplots, correlation heatmap)

Identified trends and potential outliers

3. Data Cleaning

Handled missing values

Removed or corrected inconsistencies

Standardized column names and formats

Created new derived variables where needed

Exported cleaned dataset for SQL analysis

4. SQL Querying in SQL Server

Imported cleaned dataset into SQL Server

Performed queries including:

Revenue by demographics

Product category performance

Customer segments

Discount impact analysis

Top-N product insights

Extracted results for reporting and dashboarding

5. Power BI Dashboard

Designed an interactive dashboard

Included visuals such as:

Revenue by age, gender, and category

Customer segmentation

Top-performing products

Discount and rating analysis

Added slicers for dynamic filtering

Published/shareable dashboard view

6. Reporting & Presentation (Gamma)

Summarized the entire project in a clean report

Added insights, explanations, and visuals

Created a polished PPT-style presentation using Gamma AI

📈 Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard provides:

Quick overview of key KPIs

Interactive visual exploration of customer and product patterns

Filters for category, age group, and time period

Easy insight extraction for stakeholders

📑 Results & Insights

Some high-level insights from the project (examples):

Specific age groups or genders drive higher revenue

Categories with best and worst performance

Items with highest discount usage vs. profitability

Customer segments with highest lifetime value

Product ratings correlated with purchase behavior
